Jakijudge
=========

A offline acm/oi judger for *nix system

In the past 6 months, Jakijudge is built by C++. But now, I decide to use Python to rebuild whole Jakijudge(without oidiff).
Jakijudge is a free software and published under GPLv3 or later.

Now its maintainer is a Chinese oier - Sweetdumplings(sweetdum) <linmx0130@163.com>
Jaki is the name of a lovely and kind-heated girl who helped Sweetdumplings when he was in a bad time.
