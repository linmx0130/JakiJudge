I.2 Problem Config File

	All the problem need a config file to tell Jaki where is it data and 
	limit of testing process. We call this file problem config file.

	This file should be put under the directory of the problem, and named
	"config.ini", like this:
		Test/
		|--Data/
		   |--pro1
		      |--config.ini   ***
			  |--pro1.1.in
			  |--pro1.1.out
			  |...
	This way of config is learnd form CodeBeta Online Judge, which I used 
	for more than one years.

	Here is the format of config.ini:

	The 1st line: 
		input file name|output file name|judge tool type|judge tool
	
	These string should be separated by vertical line "|". "input file name"
	is the name of the input file for program. "output file name" is the 
	name of the output file for program. 
	
	"judge tool type" will tell Jaki which diff should be used. For most
	judge task(not special judge), it should be "1". "judge tool" is the 
	name of the judge tool(diff or oidiff is mostly choices). For more 
	details about judge tool please turn to /* Depend Mark(diff) */.

	The 2nd line:
		the total of points: N
	
	This line need only an interger, telling Jaki there are how many data 
	points of the problem. If it is not an integer, Jaki will stop working.

	Then there are N lines following, each line should be written in this
	format:
		point input file|point output file|time limit|memory limit|score
	
	"point input file" is the name of input file of this point. And the 
	"point input file" is the output file name."time limit" , "memory
	limit" and "score" should be an integer. Time limit is in ms and Memory
	limit is in KB.

	Here is a example file:

		apb.in|apb.out|1|oidiff
		2
		apb1.in|apb1.out|1000|65535|50
		apb2.in|apb2.out|1000|65535|50
