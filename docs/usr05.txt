	If you want to use this kind of judge tool, you should define the judge
	tool type "0" in config.ini(for details, turn to usr_02, please).

	The special judge tool should recieve 3 arguments: the first is standard
	input file, the second is standard output file, and the last one is 
	the output file of contestant's program.

	And the judge tool should output 2 lines to stdout(screen). Jaki will 
	read them by pipe. The first line should be a integer, means how many
	percent of the point score the program can get. The second lines is the
	additional message, like "Correct", "Accept", "Wrong Answer" and so on.

	The you shold put the judge tool (binary code) under the data directory
	and jaki will call it.
