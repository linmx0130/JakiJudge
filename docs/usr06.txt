II.2 POSIX diff Standard

	Though default special judge tool standard defined a good way to 
	building special judge tool, there is a simple way to support
	special judge function. It's POSIX diff Standard.

	POSIX diff return 0 if the 2 files to compare is same and 1 if they
	are different. Your special judge tool can do like it. It should 
	recieve 2 args: the first is standard output file, and the second is
	contestant program's output file. If your "diff" return 0, it means
	the program can get 100% of the score of this point, while 1 is 0%.

	If you want to use this standard, you should defind the judge tool type
	is "1", and put the judge tool under the data directory.

	oidiff is an example of POSIX diff Standard.
