	Like other offline judge system, all the data and the source should be 
	put under a directory so that Jaki can find them and start the testing 
	processing. Here is a tree of a simple example.

		Test/                | The name of this directory is not mind.
		|--JAKI              | Contest config file *1
		|--Data/             | Data Directory
		|  |--pro1/          | Directory of Problem "pro1" *2 
		|  |--pro2/          |
		|  ...               |
        |--Src/              | Source Directory
