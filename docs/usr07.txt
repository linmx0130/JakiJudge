III.1 jaki.py

	  jaki_build will create jaki.py. If you want to run jaki in the default
	  config, you don't need to do any other modifying.

	  But you can try to modify the jaki.py to do some special settings.In
	  jaki.py, there is a function named "special_setting". It will be called
	  before the judge process. You need to use Python to tell jaki what you
	  want to do.
