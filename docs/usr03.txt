I.3 Contest Config File
	
	Jaki 0.3 use a new text file format as its Contest Config File in order
	to make Jaki easier to use and debug.

	Contest config file should be put in the directory which is including 
	the data and source. And it should be named as "JAKI". You can find a
	directory tree in usr_01.
	
	The first line of contest config file (I will call it "JAKI file below")
	is an English word, "FORMOSA", all the letter should be uppercase.

	And next line is a number N, means how many problems there are.

	Next N lines are in this format:
		Problem Name|Data Directory Name|File Name
	The "Problem Name" is only for mark the problem. But the 2nd and 3nd is
	very import. If "Data Directory Name" is "plus", Jaki will find the data
	of this problem in Data/plus/. And if "File Name" is "abc", Jaki will
	try to find abc.* in source directory (all directory in Source/). A 
	directory in Source/ is the source of a contestant. 

	Pay attention, the three data needn't be same, while in most situations
	they are same.

	If you want to set more thing, such as adding some new language or 
	change the compiling option, you need to turn to Chapter III.
